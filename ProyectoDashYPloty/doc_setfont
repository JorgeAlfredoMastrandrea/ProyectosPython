SetFont
SetFont(string family [, string style [, float size]])
Description
Sets the font used to print character strings. It is mandatory to call this method at least once before printing text or the resulting document would not be valid.
The font can be either a standard one or a font added via the AddFont() method. Standard fonts use the Windows encoding cp1252 (Western Europe).
The method can be called before the first page is created and the font is kept from page to page.
If you just wish to change the current font size, it is simpler to call SetFontSize().

Note: the font definition files must be accessible. They are searched successively in:
The directory defined by the FPDF_FONTPATH constant (if this constant is defined)
The font directory located in the same directory as fpdf.php (if it exists)
The directories accessible through include()
Example using FPDF_FONTPATH:
define('FPDF_FONTPATH','/home/www/font');
require('fpdf.php');
If the file corresponding to the requested font is not found, the error "Could not include font definition file" is raised.
Parameters
family
Family font. It can be either a name defined by AddFont() or one of the standard families (case insensitive):
Courier (fixed-width)
Helvetica or Arial (synonymous; sans serif)
Times (serif)
Symbol (symbolic)
ZapfDingbats (symbolic)
It is also possible to pass an empty string. In that case, the current family is kept.
style
Font style. Possible values are (case insensitive):
empty string: regular
B: bold
I: italic
U: underline
or any combination. The default value is regular. Bold and italic styles do not apply to Symbol and ZapfDingbats.
size
Font size in points.
The default value is the current size. If no size has been specified since the beginning of the document, the value taken is 12.
Example
// Times regular 12
$pdf->SetFont('Times');
// Arial bold 14
$pdf->SetFont('Arial','B',14);
// Removes bold
$pdf->SetFont('');
// Times bold, italic and underlined 14
$pdf->SetFont('Times','BIU');
